Change the world by scheduling Compute Engine app instance start/stop! 

This application is here to make your daily development VMs running only when you really need it. Save money by scheduling it with HTTP request. Specify when your machines should start running and when they should fall asleep. 

As a User, you can send an HTTP request to: 
- start VM
- stop VM
- list VMs status (across any region/zone)
- list Cloud Scheduler cron jobs (across any region/zone)

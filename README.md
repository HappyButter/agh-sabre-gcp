Change the world by scheduling Compute Engine app instance start/stop! 

TThis application is here to make your daily development VMs running only when you really need it. Save money by scheduling with HTTP request when your machines should start running and when they should fall asleep. 

As a User, you can send an HTTP request specifying rules for when a VM should: 
- start
- stop
